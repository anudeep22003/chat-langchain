# ChatLangChain

- This repo is my personal implementation of Langchain's sample implementation of a chatbot on their training documents. 
- Originally, this was an implementation of a chatbot specifically focused on question answering over the [LangChain documentation](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## ðŸ¥… Goals:
- Make this work over a few other documentaitons 
- Set this up to work over a text corpus that I manually create

## ðŸ§° Tools 
1. Weaviate: Vector database 
2. OpenAI: Embeddings 

## ðŸ“š Technical description

There are two components: ingestion and question-answering.

Ingestion has the following steps:

1. Pull html from documentation site
2. Parse html with BeautifulSoup
3. Split documents with LangChain's [TextSplitter](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/utils/combine_docs_examples/textsplitter.html)
4. Create a vectorstore of embeddings, using LangChain's [vectorstore wrapper](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/utils/combine_docs_examples/vectorstores.html) (with OpenAI's embeddings and Weaviate's vectorstore).

Question-Answering has the following steps:

1. Given the chat history and new user input, determine what a standalone question would be (using GPT-3).
2. Given that standalone question, look up relevant documents from the vectorstore.
3. Pass the standalone question and relevant documents to GPT-3 to generate a final answer.
